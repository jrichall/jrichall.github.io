      <h1>Podcast Studio Setup Ideas</h1>
      <h3>Based on the space and intended usage,</h3>
      <p>
        it seems there are a few options for setting up NewSkool's podcast studio. However, there are a couple of
        factors in play that may cause some issues that would require testing before fully committing.
      </p>
      <br />
      The setups below will work for both a 3 or 4 camera setup. They will also work for 1-4 people.
      <p>Please don't judge my diagrams too harshly...</p>
      <h2>The biggest challenge is also the biggest opportunity</h2>
      <p>
        <a href="/img/Img-ns/windows.jpg" target="_blank">
          <img class="inline-image" src="/img/Img-ns/windows.jpg" alt="Placeholder Image 1" />
        </a>
        The windows.
      </p>

      <p>
        The large windows in the space are terrific, but they present a potential challenge for filming. While they look
        terrific, and the industrial brick building outside would make a nice background, they'll also be tougher to
        film in front of.
      </p>

      <p>
        Recording during the day would require some fairly powerful lighting in studio. This would prevent the windows
        from being blown out (looking like they're just white) and the subjects from being poorly lit. It's do-able, but
        you're going to need to invest a bit more money in lighting.
      </p>

      <p>
        Recording at night runs the risk of something going on in the rooms across the courtyard being visible. Not a
        huge deal, as those rooms would be out of focus, but it is worth noting.
      </p>

      <p>
        It would be <i>easier</i> to build out some false walls and cover the windows. However, I really think the look
        of the window with the brick building in the background would be nice - at least worth testing before making a
        final decision.
        <br />
        <br />
        As a result, both recommendations take into account using the windows and utilizing false walls.
      </p>
      <div class="text-image-row">
        <div class="text-content">
          <h2>Middle Setup</h2>
          <p>
            This setup takes advantage of the windows (if feasible to do so, as mentioned above). I'd recommend building
            out a false wall in front of the electrical panel and using that space for a neon sign of the NewSkool logo.
          </p>

          <p>
            The wall to the left of the windows (facing the windows) presents a lot of opportunity for either artwork,
            shelves with props, and sound treatment (out of frame of the cameras).
          </p>

          <p>
            The wall to the right has some of the elements of the building, like the fire-department thing, the beams,
            and counterweight. Could also be decorated, painted, or covered.
          </p>

          <p>
            Production equipment, like a computer and sound board, would be housed in a rolling case and could be moved
            to the area of the floor between the two doors (grey floor space in the diagram). When not recording, it can
            be packed up and moved out of the way.
          </p>
        </div>
        <a href="/img/Img-ns/NewSkool%20-%20Room%20-%20Windows.png" target="_blank">
          <img class="inline-image" src="/img/Img-ns/NewSkool%20-%20Room%20-%20Windows.png" alt="Middle Setup"
        />
        </a>
      </div>
        <div class="text-image-row">
          <div class="text-content">
            <h2>Corner Setup</h2>
            <p>This setup provides more floor space for equipment and also brings people a bit closer together. You can either use a false wall to block the window, or see if it works as a background. The wall with the beams could be painted, or have props.</p>
          </div>
              <a href="/img/Img-ns/NewSkool%20-%20Room%20-%20Corner%20w_%20False%20Wall.png" target="_blank">
                <img
                  class="inline-image"
                  src="/img/Img-ns/NewSkool%20-%20Room%20-%20Corner%20w_%20False%20Wall.png"
                  alt="Corner" />
              </a>
        </div>
        <div class="text-image-row">
          <div class="text-content">
            <h2>Both setups</h2>
            <p>
              <br />
              Access to power on the ceiling makes for easier lighting installation. Some simple pipes suspended from
              the ceiling would allow for both lighting fixtures as well as sound treatment.
            </p>

            <p>
              A large area rug will help cut down on echo, and also reduce any noise from chairs or the table being
              moved.
            </p>
            <p>
              Speaking of chairs, you'd want to go with non-spinning options. I would recommend some "modern" armchairs
              and a coffee/cocktail table.
